The [EMNLP2020](https://github.com/acl-org/emnlp-2020-virtual-conference) virtual conference website 
uses [MiniConf](https://github.com/Mini-Conf/Mini-Conf) built by Hendrik Strobelt and Sasha Rush that
was extended by the [amazing team of ACL 2020](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-2020-virtual-conference).
The EMNLP2020 infrastructure committee is very grateful to the [volunteers](static/pdf/volunteers.pdf) and 
contributors whose valuable contributions to building the virtual infrastructure made the conference possible.
We would also like to thank [Nitin Madnani](https://desilinguist.org/) for his advice and IT
support regarding the virtual infrastructure. We also want to thank AI2 for contributing 
the [SPECTER model](https://github.com/allenai/specter) used in the "Similar Papers" feature, 
David Wadden et al. for [DyGIE++](https://github.com/dwadden/dygiepp) that generated paper keywords for us 
and the team of [Connected Papers](https://www.connectedpapers.com/) for providing us with citation graphs.
